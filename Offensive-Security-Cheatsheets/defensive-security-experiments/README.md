# \[De\|Of\]fensive Security Experiments

The goal of this project is simple - execute some common/uncommon attacking techniques and:

* understand how the attacks can be performed 
* see what artifacts they leave behind 
* see what data sources could be leveraged by the defenders to spot evil
* try out various industry tools and become more profficient in using them
* write the techniques down and make this book as a reference for the future :\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that these are just my personal notes that happen to be accessible publicly.   
Do not take everything or anything for granted nor expect the notes to be very detailed or covering the techniques or the artifacts they leave in full.   
  
Consider yourself informed!
